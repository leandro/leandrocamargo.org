            <li>Software Engineer based in Goiânia, Brazil.</li>
            <li>Working professionally since 2004.</li>
            <li>Around 13 years of experience working remotely.</li>
            <li>Expertises: systems design, performance optimization, refactoring, full stack web development, DX.</li>
            <li>15/16 years of experience with Ruby/Rails.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Fond of simple and yet elegant solutions. Keen eye for design and usability. I really enjoy writing reusable code/lib aiming the programmers themselves as the end users (DX). Concerned about good quality code and good communication with peers and customers. Empathy is a very important thing to me. I'm also open/interested to learn new technologies (or technologies I'm not experienced with yet), like Go, Node.js, Rust, Flutter, React Native, etc.</p>

            <h4>Full Stack Web Developer @ Lawmatics</h4>
            <div class="period">Jan 2021 - Present</div>
            <p>I've gone through two different stages in the company so far: the first one was more product driven, where I developed new features (using Rails and React), services, fixed bugs and improved performance of existing features and services. I worked a lot with a variety of third party integrations we have and developed some of them from scratch, including the RingCentral one, handling real-time ingoing/outgoing phone calls and their multiple events.</p>
            <p>The second stage happened when I moved into the Reliablity team (of which I'm still part), as soon as it was created in the company. There I did and still do many important performance optimizations related to PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq, Elasticsearch and many thorough ActiveRecord analysis &amp; optimizations in our Rails codebase. I really enjoy doing this kind of work: monitoring, analyzing and investigating metrics, doing important refactoring of code, planning data modeling and system architecture in general, planning a rework of parts of the system that are not performing well, like I'm currently doing with our CSV based importing system, which is a core feature to our business, but also contains several performance issues at the moment.</p>
